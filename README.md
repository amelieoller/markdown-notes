# Markdown Notes

Markdown Notes is an application that helps you keep all your notes in one place. You can write notes in markdown which gets turned into HTML so you can see your notes transform in real time.

## Motivation

I had always wanted to create my own markdown editor to keep track of my notes. Since I found `remirror`, it has made the journey easier than ever. In addition to the notes section, I also added a lecture section that will allow you to create lectures from your existing notes (I was teaching programming at the time I built this).

## Screenshots
